# setting up Django to practice SQL injection
###### To set up, I referred to Django official documents: [Django official](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

### 0. Preparation
Python must be installed.  
The code will be written on Visual Studio(VS).

-----------

### 1. Install a virtual environment
The reason for the need for an independent virtual environment is to prevent Python libraries downloaded from the Internet from causing conflicts. (External libraries are often dependent on each other, which can cause malfunction if the version is not correct)  
Turn on the terminal in VS and type in the working directory :

    python -m venv venv

The first venv is python module and the second venv would be the name of the virtual environment.  
</br>
These would be installed:  
![virtual env install](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63287638/120278132-dc10e880-c2ef-11eb-9467-dbf6cd484398.PNG)
</br>
To activate virtual environment(venv), move to(cd) ~~venv/Scripts and type .\acitvate. Then venv will be executed.

-----------

### 2. Install Django and start a project
In Scripts directory, type : 

    pip install django

When you type "pip freeze", Django==x.x.x (x.x.x means version) would be included.
</br>
Move to project's root directory, where you will start a project.
</br>
Then type in your terminal like:

    django-admin startproject ~~~

In my case, to express it has vulnerabilites, the name of the project is vulSite.
</br>
These would be installed including manage.py  
![start project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63287638/120280136-4591f680-c2f2-11eb-8639-dcaacb513b76.PNG)
</br>

### 3. Install an app
An app refers to an application that performs a particular function, while a project refers to putting those apps together. Therefore, different functions are implemented by different apps.
</br>
</br>
Type in your terminal:

    py manage.py startapp app_name

These would be installed  
![startapp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63287638/120281293-b8e83800-c2f3-11eb-9a57-1453c5a13ef3.PNG)
</br>
'users' app will be composed of the code related to login and it will show form based sql injection.  
'posts' app will be composed of the code related to post and it will show blind sql injection.
</br>
